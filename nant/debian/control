Description: build tool similar to Ant
 NAnt is different than Make.  Instead of a model where it is extended with
 shell-based commands, NAnt is extended using task classes.  Instead of
 writing shell commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling
 out a target tree where various tasks get executed.  Each task is run
 by an object that implements a particular Task interface.
 .
 NAnt supports different target frameworks:
  - Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 through 4.0, plus Silverlight
  - Mono 1.0 through 4.0
